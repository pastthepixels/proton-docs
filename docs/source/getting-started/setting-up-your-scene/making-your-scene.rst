Making Your Scene
=================
For this game, we're simply going to start out with a base and a player.
The base can be any platform you see fit to make in Blender-just watch the physics impostor type when importing the platform-but for this step-by-step guide
we'll only need to make a rectangular prism for the base.
Again, to do this, we're going to need Blender. You can find it at "blender.org <https://blender.org/download>"_, or on Debian systems, install it with the command:

.. code-block:: bash
    sudo apt install blender

Note that you are running Debian (or a Debian-based system), so you won't have the latest version of Blender by installing it this way.





Start by launching Blender. You'll notice a cube, a camera, and a light. You'll need to remove the camera and the light by clicking on them and pressing the delete key.

Now, I strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with Blender if you haven't already. From this point on, I'll assume that you, like me, have intermediate knowledge of Blender.

Once you  have the scene with just a cube, you are going to resize it. Note that Blender uses thae Z-axis to point upwards, so we want to scale the object to something like the ordered pair ( 20, 20, .5 )
