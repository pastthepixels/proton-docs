Welcome to Proton's documentation!
==================================
The Proton engine is a free and open source game engine with these core focuses:

- Performance
- Ease of use
- Flexibility

and

- Being a different game engine: one where both novices and experts can program their games with code instead of visual environments.

Feel free to look around, and I hope you have fun with Proton!
