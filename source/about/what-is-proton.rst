What is Proton?
===============
Taken from the README:

The Proton engine is a free and open source game engine with these core focuses:

- Performance
- Ease of use
- Flexibility

and

- Being a different game engine; one where both novices and experts can program their games with code instead of visual programming.

Well, there are many engines that provide the first three points. Even FLOSS ones; Godot is a great example of one of these engines.
For me, however, I just felt more comfortable making a game through just whipping something up on VSCodium, and here we are. I like making
engines, although it seems pretty weird considering I don't want to add an extra `standard <https://xkcd.com/927/>`_ to making games, but
that's where the Proton3DInterpreter comes in. I aim for Proton to be a vary minimal game engine that uses this interpreter to talk convert
Proton stuff to stuff in any desired engine, thus reducing the trouble of having to maintain yet another game engine while still achieving
my main goals! In the future, I hope to be able to make Proton work across multiple programming languages so that you can work in your
preferred style when making a game. I hope you enjoy Proton as much as I do making it!
